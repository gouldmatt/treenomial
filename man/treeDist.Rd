\title{Calculates the distance between trees}
\usage{
treeDist(x, Y, type = "real", method = "logDiff")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{single phylo object}

\item{Y}{a list of class phylo}

\item{type}{one of:
\describe{
  \item{\dQuote{real}}{real coefficient polynomials}
  \item{\dQuote{complex}}{complex coefficient polynomials (real polynomials with y = 1 + i)}
  \item{\dQuote{tipLabel}}{complex coefficient polynomial that utilize binary trait tip labels on the phylo objects}
}}

\item{method}{method to use when calculating coefficient distances:
\describe{
  \item{\dQuote{logDiff}}{for two coefficient matrices A and B returns sum(log(1+abs(A-B))}
  \item{\dQuote{wLogDiff}}{performs the \dQuote{logDiff} method with weights on the rows}
  \item{\dQuote{pa}}{total pairs where the coefficient is present in one matrix and absent in the other (presence-absence)}
  \item{\dQuote{ap}}{opposite comparison of pa (absence-presence)}
}}
}
\value{
vector of distances
}
\description{
Calculates the distance between two trees or a tree and a list of trees.
}
\note{
\itemize{
  \item the complex coefficient vector and the complex tip label coefficient matrix only support the \dQuote{logDiff} method
  \item \dQuote{pa} and \dQuote{ap} force symmetry in the output distance matrix
}
}
\examples{
library(treenomial)
library(ape)

# distance between one 10 tip tree and 100 trees with 30 tips

# generate the trees
tenTipTree <- rtree(10)
thirtyTipList <- rmtree(100,30)

# find the distance
treeDist(tenTipTree,thirtyTipList)
