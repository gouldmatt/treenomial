\title{Calculates the distance matrix from a list of phylo objects}
\usage{
treeToDistMat(
  trees,
  method = c("fraction", "logDiff", "wLogDiff", "pa", "ap"),
  type = c("default", "yEvaluated", "tipLabel"),
  y,
  numThreads = -1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{a single phylo object or a list of phylo objects}

\item{method}{method to use when calculating coefficient distances:
\describe{
  \item{\dQuote{fraction}}{for two coefficient matrices A and B returns sum(abs(A-B)/(A+B)), excluding elements where both A and B are zero}
  \item{\dQuote{logDiff}}{for two coefficient matrices A and B returns sum(log(1+abs(A-B))}
  \item{\dQuote{wLogDiff}}{performs the \dQuote{logDiff} method with weights on the rows}
  \item{\dQuote{pa}}{total pairs where the coefficient is present in one matrix and absent in the other (presence-absence)}
  \item{\dQuote{ap}}{opposite comparison of pa (absence-presence)}
}}

\item{type}{one of:
\describe{
  \item{\dQuote{real}}{tree distinguishing polynomials in two variables x (columns) and y (rows)}
  \item{\dQuote{yEvaluated}}{tree distinguishing polynomials with y evaluated at a specified argument}
  \item{\dQuote{tipLabel}}{complex coefficient polynomial that utilize binary trait tip labels on the phylo objects}
}}

\item{y}{the y value to evaluate the polynomial at when type is \dQuote{yEvaluated}, ignored otherwise}

\item{numThreads}{number of threads to be used, the default (-1) will use the number of cores in the machine and numThreads = 0 will only use the main thread}
}
\value{
a distance matrix
}
\description{
Calculates the distance matrix from a list of phylo objects
}
\note{
\itemize{
  \item the substituted y coefficient vector only supports the \dQuote{logDiff} method and the \dQuote{fraction} method
  \item \dQuote{pa} and \dQuote{ap} force symmetry in the output distance matrix
}
}
\examples{

library(treenomial)
library(ape)
# distance matrix for 10 trees of 30 tips
treeToDistMat(rmtree(10, 30), method = "wLogDiff", numThreads = 0)
}
